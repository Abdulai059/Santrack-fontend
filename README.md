## Executive Summary

SaniTrack Climate is a geospatial intelligence and incident response platform purpose-built for sanitation infrastructure monitoring in climate-vulnerable regions of Northern Ghana. The system provides district officers, NGO field teams, health authorities, and community agents with a unified operational picture — combining real-time GIS mapping, sanitation incident reporting, climate event tracking, and field worker coordination into a single deployable web application. Designed to operate in low-bandwidth environments and align with UNICEF WASH programme standards, SaniTrack Climate transforms fragmented, paper-based sanitation data into actionable intelligence that protects children's health and strengthens community resilience against floods, droughts, and contamination events.

## Problem Statement

Northern Ghana faces a compounding public health crisis at the intersection of climate change and inadequate sanitation infrastructure. The region experiences increasingly severe flood and drought cycles that systematically destroy latrines, contaminate water sources, and render school sanitation facilities non-functional — disproportionately affecting children under five and school-age girls.

Key data points framing the problem:

- **Open defecation rates** in Northern Ghana remain among the highest in West Africa, with rural coverage for improved sanitation below 15% in some districts (WHO/UNICEF JMP, 2023).
- **Flood events** in the Upper East and Upper West regions have increased in frequency by over 40% in the past decade, with each event destroying an estimated 20–35% of community latrine infrastructure.
- **No real-time monitoring system** exists at the district level to track sanitation asset status, report contamination events, or coordinate emergency WASH response.
- **School WASH gaps** leave millions of children without access to functional toilets during and after climate events, driving absenteeism — particularly among adolescent girls.
- **Response lag** between incident occurrence and field team deployment averages 72–96 hours due to manual, phone-based reporting chains.

The absence of geospatial situational awareness means that district health officers and NGO partners are making resource allocation decisions without reliable, current data — a gap SaniTrack Climate is designed to close.

---

## Solution Overview

SaniTrack Climate provides a layered operational platform with four core capabilities:

1. **Geospatial Infrastructure Registry** — A live GIS map of sanitation assets (latrines, water points, schools, community facilities) with status indicators, enabling district-level visibility of infrastructure health at a glance.

2. **Real-Time Incident Reporting** — Field agents and community reporters submit sanitation incidents (structural damage, contamination, overflow, non-functionality) directly through the platform. Reports are geotagged, severity-classified, and immediately visible to response coordinators.

3. **Field Worker Tracking & Dispatch** — GPS-enabled live tracking of field workers and response teams on the operational map, with route history and navigation support for efficient deployment to incident sites.

4. **Climate Event & Risk Dashboard** — Aggregated view of active climate events (floods, droughts, contamination alerts) overlaid on infrastructure data, enabling risk prioritization and pre-emptive resource positioning.

The system is role-aware, serving nine distinct user types from community agents to national administrators, with access controls enforced at both the application and database layers.

**Data flow:** Field agents submit incidents or GPS positions via the web client. Supabase Realtime broadcasts changes over WebSocket to all connected dashboards simultaneously — no polling, no refresh required. Row-Level Security (RLS) policies ensure each role sees only the data they are authorized to access.

## Data Model

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `profiles` | User accounts with role assignment, linked to Supabase Auth |
| `locations` | Sanitation infrastructure assets (latrines, water points, facilities) with coordinates and operational status |
| `communities` | Community boundaries and demographic metadata for geofenced zones |
| `sanitation_reports` | Field-submitted incident reports with severity, type, geolocation, and media attachments |
| `climate_events` | Logged climate events (floods, droughts, contamination) with affected area geometry |
| `schools` | School registry with WASH facility inventory and current operational status |
| `water_sources` | Water point registry with quality status, type, and contamination risk flags |
| `user_locations` | Real-time GPS position stream for field worker tracking and route history |

All geospatial data is stored as coordinate pairs compatible with PostGIS extension queries. Row-Level Security policies on Supabase enforce data access boundaries per role at the database layer — not just the application layer.

## User Roles & Permissions

| Role | Access Scope |
|---|---|
| `admin` | Full system access — user management, all data, configuration |
| `district_officer` | District-scoped read/write on incidents, locations, climate events, and reports |
| `health_officer` | Read access to all health-relevant data; can submit and close sanitation reports |
| `ngo` | Read access to locations and incidents; can submit reports and view field worker positions |
| `response_team` | GPS tracking enabled; can update incident status and log field actions |
| `operator` | Submit and manage sanitation reports for assigned locations |
| `headteacher` | School-scoped access — submit and view WASH reports for their institution |
| `community_agent` | Submit incident reports and view local infrastructure status |
| `visitor` | Read-only access to public map layers; no submission capability |

Role assignment is managed in the `profiles` table and enforced via Supabase RLS policies. The application layer additionally gates UI routes and components by role using the `AuthContext`.

## Technology Stack

| Technology | Role | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Next.js 15** | Frontend framework | App Router enables hybrid SSR/CSR rendering — critical pages load fast even on slow connections; dynamic imports keep the Leaflet bundle client-only |
| **Supabase** | Backend, Auth, Database, Storage, Realtime | Eliminates the need for a custom API server; built-in Realtime WebSocket engine powers live incident and worker tracking without additional infrastructure |
| **PostgreSQL (via Supabase)** | Relational database | Mature, reliable, PostGIS-compatible; RLS policies enforce multi-tenant data isolation at the database layer |
| **Leaflet + OpenStreetMap** | GIS mapping | Open-source, lightweight, and works offline with tile caching — appropriate for low-bandwidth field environments; no API key or usage cost |
| **Tailwind CSS** | UI styling | Utility-first approach enables rapid, consistent UI development; responsive design is first-class, supporting both desktop dashboards and mobile field use |

- Automated alert generation when climate event boundaries intersect with high-density sanitation infrastructure zones
- Predictive maintenance scoring for aging latrine infrastructure

**Phase 3 — Offline & Low-Connectivity Access**
- SMS/USSD incident reporting interface for feature phone users and areas without internet access
- Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline map tile caching and queued report submission
- WhatsApp Bot integration for community-level incident submission

**Phase 4 — Sensor Integration**
- IoT sensor integration for water quality monitoring (turbidity, pH, E. coli indicators)
- Automated contamination alerts triggered by sensor threshold breaches
- Integration with Ghana Meteorological Agency (GMet) API for real-time weather and flood warning data

**Phase 5 — Interoperability**
- DHIS2 data export for integration with Ghana Health Service national reporting systems
- OpenStreetMap contribution pipeline for verified infrastructure data
- API endpoints for third-party NGO and government system integration

## Impact

SaniTrack Climate directly addresses three of the most critical gaps in Northern Ghana's public health infrastructure:

**Child Health Protection**
Real-time visibility of school WASH facility status enables district health officers to prioritize repairs and ensure children have access to functional sanitation — reducing diarrheal disease transmission and keeping girls in school.

**Climate Resilience**
By mapping the intersection of climate events and sanitation infrastructure in real time, the platform enables pre-emptive resource positioning before floods peak — reducing the window between infrastructure failure and response from days to hours.

**WASH System Accountability**
A permanent, auditable record of infrastructure status, incident reports, and response actions creates the data foundation for evidence-based WASH investment decisions by district governments and international donors.
